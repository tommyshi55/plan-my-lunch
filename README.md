# Plan My Lunch (Work In Progress)
A cross-platform mobile application that helps user plan their daily lunch at school/work for each week.

## Ideation
With this app, the user can:
- Login/signup with an account, with email and password or using third-party Google/Facebook
- Plan workday lunch
- Search restaurant/takeaway near school/univeristy/work via Zomato API. (Phase 1)
- Record that to use leftover from last night for lunch for the next work day. (Phase 1)
- Search healthy recipe to prep their own lunch. (Phase 2)

## Technologies Will be Used
- Flutter, Dart (mobile frontend)
- Firebase (For user authentication, cloud NoSQL database, cloud serverless function)
- NodeJS (For the implementation of Firebase Cloud Function)

## Current Progress
Currently I am developing the frontend screens for Phase 1. That includes the login/signup/welcome screen. The main screen to plan the lunch. The screens to search restaurants and how to display the plan
